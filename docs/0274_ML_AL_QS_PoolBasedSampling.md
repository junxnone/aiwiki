# Pool-Based Sampling

## Brief
- Select samples
  - single
  - batch
- Tasks
  - Text Classification
  - Information Extraction
  - Image Classification
  - Image Retrieval
  - Video Clasification
  - Video Retrieval
  - Speech Recognition
  - Cancer diagnosis

## `Pool-Based` vs `Stream-Based`

Name | Description
-- | --
`Pool-Based`  | 从 Pool 中选取 Batch (考虑总体分布)
`Stream-Based` | 使用策略选择每个 sample 是否作为 Input (一个个的判断)
